# OCCRP JSON Schema Definitions

This repository features schema for entity types (such as people, companies,
assets etc.) commonly seen in OCCRP-managed datasets. The schemas are defined
using a subset of [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) with several
additional properties that have been defined to control the transformation of
JSON objects into a graph.

Based on:

* [Popolo](https://github.com/popolo-project/popolo-spec)
* [OpenCorporates Schema](https://github.com/openc/openc-schema)
